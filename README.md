# Bookswapper App for Android

These are the sources for the Bookswapper App that I developed a few years ago to work with the website http://www.bookswapper.de

I didn't have the time to work on it any more so I'm making it publically available here under the GPLv3 Licence, in case someone wants to carry on the work.

**Please note** that I have no affiliation with the developers of the bookswapper.de website, I just like the site and thought it would be nice to have an app to work with it.

## Some Info

The FREE online book swap for English books in Germany!


Imagine a second-hand book store where you show up with 5 English paperback novels that you've read and don't want to keep. You put them on the counter and the shop assistant says: Okay, off you go and pick 5 new ones from our vast shelves....

That's exactly how bookswapper.de works. And now there's this App that will keep you swapping books on the go as well!

It even has a bar code scanner to make it easier to list your own books on the site so you don't have to do any typing!


How it works:

(1) Sign Up on the website

There are no strings attached here: your data is safe with us and swapping is for free!

(2) List books

List as many books as you like (a minimum of 5 books will earn you a free token and you can start swapping immediately).
You can list books directly with the App by scanning the bar code on the back or entering the details yourself, or use the website instead.

(3) Receive books

Got that free token? Then browse the catalogue and choose any book you like. Click on swap book and it will be in your mailbox soon. Don't forget to confirm that you received the book on the website in my swaps and to give the sender feedback on the transaction!

(4) Send books

Next thing you know: Someone orders one of the books you have on offer. You ship it to the address given and as soon as the recipient confirms the arrival of the book you have a new token to spend.

Okay, this should get you started. There are more features on the website - have fun exploring them and check the FAQ when in doubt.

Happy Swapping!
